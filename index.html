      <h2>About The Author</h2>

      <p>
        In 1928, British Government decided to send Simon Commission to India to
        discuss constitutional reforms. The Commission had no Indian member.
        This greatly angered Indians. In Lahore, Lajpat Rai led one such
        procession against Simon Commission along with Pandit Madan Mohan
        Malaviya. While the procession was peaceful, British Government brutally
        lathicharged the procession. Lajpat Rai was badly injured and died on
        November 17th.
